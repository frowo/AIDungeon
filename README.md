A massive thank you to the /aids/ anon who singlehandedly worked on the word penalties system, and helped my absolutely fried brain implementing it properly

Don't expect anything, I am a brainlet, this is for fun

**Goal of this fork**
There are two things that I am trying to fix with this fork

First off, it is very clear to me that other forks, mainly clover, is (or was, since the github seems inactive) "bleeding-edge", implementing new features instantly or completely rewriting others (such as implementing pytorch), to me, this is unnecessary and can make development more complicated.
While other forks are trying to be the "Arch" of AID2, mine is aiming to be "Debian", implementing stable, useful features, and keeping everything simple

Second off, like many open source projects, development is happening in different places, and this can get confusing, I will admit, I am sort of making <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png">this mistake</a>, but I hope that I can manage to create a "universal Lucidteller", by simplifying it for newcomers (yes, it must accessible to the biggest brainlet) by keeping default options simple (such as the one click start as default), as well as keeping a simple wiki and colab 
However, I also want to appeal to those who like digging through settings and changing variables, this is why a config file was added, anyone who wants to quickly change something can do so.

Hopefully, this fork will stay active
